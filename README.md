## What is it?
This web-app takes MIDI files and converts them into a reference for a DIY music box, which is a music box that uses paper strips to play any song. 

What is unique about the MIDI Visualizer for Music Box is that you can change the spacing of the notes so that they can be closer together or further apart. This allows you to punch notes in between the lines, which:
1. reduces the amount of paper needed to punch a tune (often by half!).
2. reduces the tempo, allowing for a more comfortable turning speed.

## How do I use it?
You'll need [a MIDI file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eMSWpg9X9U09teUOskrfChGhPKf1sW56/view?usp=sharing) on hand to test (though I'm working on that!). Click on "Select a MIDI file" and then the file will display on the visualizer.
